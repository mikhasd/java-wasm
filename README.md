java-wasm
=========

This a playground project in which I'll perform a couple of experiments with [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

My personal goals includes (my are not limited to):

- Generate executable WebAssembly binaries
- Parse WebAssembly binary files (.wasm)
- Provide a reasonaly user friendly API to generate WASM binaries
- Execute WebAssembly code in interpreted mode
- Generate valid java bytecode from wasm modules

Colaboration
